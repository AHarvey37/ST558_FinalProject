## Introduction

This project will use the "diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015" dataset. According [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/data) this data set contains 253,680 observation where the response variable is whether the observed individual does not have diabetes (0) or has prediabetes/diabetes (1). While the dataset is in a numeric format the following vaiables are categorical:

1. Diabetes_binary (response variable)
2. HighBP
3. HighChol
4. CholCheck
5. Smoker
6. Stroke
7. HeartDiseaseorAttack
8. PhysActivity
9. Fruits
10. Veggies
11. HvyAlcoholConsump
12. AnyHealthcare
13. NoDocbcCost
14. DiffWalk
15. Sex

The following variables are continuous in the dataset:
1. BMI
2. GenHlth
3. MentHlth
4. PhysHlth
5. Age
6. Education
7. Income

}
